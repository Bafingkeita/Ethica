🌱 Ethica  Invest With Intention

Ethica is a web app that helps people build a portfolio aligned with their values — whether that’s sustainability, religion, innovation, or just common sense.

    Today, you can filter by market cap.
    But not by conviction.

💡 Why Ethica?

Most investment platforms feel cold, complex, or overwhelming — especially for beginners.

Ethica was born from a simple idea:
Make investing feel more human.

Instead of focusing on raw numbers and complex charts, Ethica helps users:

    Simulate real trades

    Track their balance over time

    Understand market events through a chatbot

    Discover assets aligned with their personal profile

It’s not a “Wall Street simulator.”
It’s a tool to help people invest in what matters to them.
